Now I\'m chasing after antidotes For anything that tastes like a quick fix Days like this, no, nothing feels right Nothing sticks, I can\'t get out my mind Tell myself to let it go I wish that I could let it go It\'s hard to keep it down now But I need to let the fever sweat out Now I can\'t stand still Should be runnin\' free And all these nightmares used to be daydreams I got my eyes wide open Don\'t wanna care \'bout nothin\' Wish I could know less, just go back to bed \'Cause all my pink skies have been painted red If this is real don\'t show it I wanna run blindfolded Reality\'s a bitter taste But fantasy can be so deceiving All my good intentions gone to waste I\'ll do anything to shut out this feeling I can\'t go back, no, I\'ve gone too far I miss the way that my eyes filled with stars Tell myself to let it go, but I don\'t I wish that I could let it go Now I can\'t stand still Should be runnin\' free And all these nightmares used to be daydreams I got my eyes wide open Don\'t wanna care \'bout nothin\' Wish I could know less, just go back to bed \'Cause all my pink skies have been painted red If this is real don\'t show it I wanna run blindfolded Take a sip, have it anyway you want it Drink it in, let us finish what you started Throw a fit, yeah I guess I shoulda called it Now it\'s stolen I\'m blindfolded Stand still Should be runnin\' free And all these nightmares used to be daydreams I got my eyes wide open Don\'t wanna care \'bout nothin\' Wish I could know less, just go back to bed \'Cause all my pink skies have been painted red If this is real don\'t show it I wanna run blindfolded',
