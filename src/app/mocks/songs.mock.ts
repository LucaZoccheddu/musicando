  lyrics: "Common love isn't for us\nWe created something phenomenal\nDon't you agree? Don't you agree?\nYou got me feeling diamond-rich\nNothing on this planet compares to it\nDon't you agree? Don't you agree?\nWho needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?\nAll night, I'll riot with you\nI know you got my back, and you know I got you\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)\nLet's get physical\nLights out, follow the noise\nBaby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on\nLet's get physical\nAdrenaline keeps on rushing in\nLove the simulation we're dreaming in\nDon't you agree? Don't you agree?\nI don't wanna live another life\n'Cause this one's pretty nice\nLiving it up\nWho needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?\nAll night, I'll riot with you\nI know you got my back, and you know I got you\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on (come on)\nLet's get physical\nLights out, follow the noise\nBaby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on\nLet's get physical\nHold on just a little tighter\nCome on, hold on, tell me if you're ready\nCome on (come on, come on)\nBaby, keep on dancing\nLet's get physical\nHold on just a little tighter\nCome on, hold on, tell me if you're ready\nCome on (come on, come on)\nBaby, keep on dancing\nLet's get physical\nAll night, I'll riot with you\nI know you got my back, and you know I got you\nSo come on, come on, come on\nLet's get physical\nLights out, follow the noise\nBaby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice\nSo come on (come on), come on (come on), come on\nLet's get physical (physical, physical)\nLet's get physical (physical, physical)\nPhysical (physical, physical)\nLet's get physical (physical, physical)\nCome on, phy-phy-phy-physical",

  lyrics: "I never thought that I would find a way out\nI never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud\nI can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore\nBut goddamn, you got me in love again\nI used to think that I was made out of stone\nI used to spend so many nights on my own\nI never knew I had it in me to dance anymore\nBut goddamn, you got me in love again\nShow me that heaven's right here, baby\nTouch me, so I know I'm not crazy\nNever have I ever met somebody like you\nUsed to be afraid of love and what it might do\nBut goddamn, you got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nAgain\nSo many nights, my tears fell harder than rain\nScared I would take my broken heart to the grave\nI'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before\nBut goddamn, you got me in love again\nShow me that heaven's right here, baby\nTouch me, so I know I'm not crazy\nNever have I ever met somebody like you\nUsed to be afraid of love, and what it might do\nBut goddamn, you got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nAgain\nI can't believe, I can't believe\nI finally found someone\nI'll sink my teeth in disbelief\n'Cause you're the one that I want\nI can't believe, I can't believe\nI'm not afraid anymore\nGoddamn, you got me in love again\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\nI never thought that I would find a way out\nI never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud\nI can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore\nOh, goddamn, you got me in love again\nI can't believe, I can't believe\nI finally found someone\nI'll sink my teeth in disbelief\n'Cause you're the one that I want\nI can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore\nBut goddamn, you got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nYou got me in love again\nYou got me in love again (again and again)\nAgain (and again and again and again)",
